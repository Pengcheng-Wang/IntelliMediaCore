# IntelliMediaCore
Collection of C# design patterns (MVVM, Repository, Promise, Singleton) and utility classes. The class library is intended to be used in conjunction with Unity 3D game engine projects or Mono-based servers and tools.

**NOTE:** This is an **alpha** release of the class library. There is no overview documentation or binary distributions available at this time. Use at your own risk. The class library will continue to evolve over the coming months, placing it on GitHub is just the first step.

## Build requirements
Either of these environments can be used to build IntelliMediaCore:
* [Unity 5 Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/)
* [Xamarin Studio 5](https://xamarin.com)

## How-to integrate into a Unity 5 project

For now, simply take a snapshot of the source and place the IntelliMediaCore dirctory in your Unity project's **Assets** directory. Refer to the [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/IntelliMedia/TicTacToe) sample for examples of how to use some of the classes. More documentation and examples will be created in the future.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of new features, improvements, and bug fixes from the community. However, since this is our first attempt at an open source project, we haven't quite figured out the logisitics, yet. Contact us at intellimedia@ncsu.edu if you are interested in contributing. Once we have a policy we'll update this text.
