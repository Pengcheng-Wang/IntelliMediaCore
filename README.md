# IntelliMediaCore
Collection of C# design patterns (MVVM, Repository, Singleton) and utility classes. The class library is intended to be used in conjunction with Unity 3D game engine projects and Mono-based servers and tools.

**NOTE:** This is an **alpha** release of the class library. There are no binary distributions available at this time. The preferred approach is to create a Git subtree of the IntelliMediaCore/Source in your project's Git repository.  

Refer to the wiki for [detailed instructions](https://github.com/IntelliMedia/IntelliMediaCore/wiki) on how to integrate IntelliMediaCore into your project.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions of new features, improvements, and bug fixes from the community. However, since this is our first attempt at an open source project, we haven't quite figured out the logisitics, yet. Contact us at intellimedia@ncsu.edu if you are interested in contributing. Once we have a policy we'll update this text.
